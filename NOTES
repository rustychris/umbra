with backrefs, max_depth=5, see more of the picture.

vector layer is referenced in locals, fine, but mostly
the dict behind UgQgis.
That dict also references, via self.tool, the UgEditTool.
UgEditTool in turn references UgQgis, so there's a cycle there,
not great.

On top of that, QgsMapCanvas holds a reference to the tool.
And that is probably bad - because MapCanvas will continue to
call any callbacks.
