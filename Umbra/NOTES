Crashing when adding the MapLayer.

Seg fault is down in QgsLegendLayer::updateIcon(), according
to gdb.

Upgrading to Lyon, 2.12, and it runs just fine.

It does show the editor tool pointer.

Clicking prints "Add", "Add" and gives a python error - stale calls to time.time()

Depending on the file format, need to either target a directory or a single file,
and call the corresponding qt dialog.

On removing plugin, cancel the callbacks, otherwise we get duplicate dialogs.
 - hmm - even on a fresh load of the plugin and QGIS, get 3 responses to the 
   browse button.


Fixed by skipping the auto-binding.

Next: 
 - loading multiple grids worked briefly, showed the edits just fine, but then the 
   edited grid disappeared. ???
   fresh qgis, no plugin reloads.  load one grid, load second grid.  first grid
    displays briefly, but then stops.
   all is fine before zooming at all...
   it's zooming which screws it up.


   - kill the_layer global
   - make sure repaint_freezes/queued are instance local
   - still doesn't work.
   - the second layer receives two calls to extent() both when it is unchecked and
     rechecked.  first layer only gets a call to extent() when it's checked.
   - calls to draw on only the second layer.

   - odd that when it goes to remove the layers, only one of them is recognized as an
     umbra layer.  the other is a 'qgis._core.QgsPluginLayer' 

   - my_repaint appears to be called only on the last layer loaded.
   - so as soon as a new layer is added, the previous one seems to lose it's identity
     as an umbra_layer.
   - opening python console causes both layers to lose their identities.

   - any chance that having unique names would help this out?  or some other
     
   - this is either a QGIS bug, or common misuse.  The openlayers plugin has this same
     issue.  Openlayers issue 10930 says this has been fixed since version 1.3.4 of
     the plugin.  Submitted update to that issue.

     does this occur just with plugin layers of the same type?  
     with any plugin layer? can add an open streetmap layer, and it seems fine.
     can load two open streetmap layers, and the first will disappear, but the grid 
       is still fine.
     with any layer at all?
     what if the UmbraLayer class wasn't shared between layers?
       no help.

 - dealing with cells!
    * display cell centers
    * delete cell by right-click on cell center
    * add cell with clean click in middle of polygon (<7 sides)
