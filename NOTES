There is a sneaky bug where seemingly random cells get deleted.
  - maybe related to undo?
  - infrequent, happens to cells not necessarily near the edit
    area

When a layer fails to load, it seems to break the loading of Umbra
itself.

##

UI:
 - looks like when scale is used on shared edges it actually edits the original
   grid, replacing positive scales with negative scales. can be confusing.
   

quad generator / quad laplacian:
 - extra edges in the generator grid will confuse it, even if they are deleted.
   should at least renumber before attempting.
